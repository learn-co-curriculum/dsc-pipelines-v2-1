Recall how we start preparing our dataset: we want to clean our data, transform it, potentially use feature selection, and then run a machine learning algorithm. Using pipelines, you can do all these steps in one go! Additionally, pipelines help prevent data leakage during cross-validation, which is often a concern when using the `GridSearchCV` module.\n", "\n", "Pipeline functionality can be found in scikit-learn's `Pipeline` module. Pipelines can be coded in a very simple way:\n", "\n", "```python\n", "from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n", "\n", "# Create the pipeline\n", "pipe = Pipeline([('mms', MinMaxScaler()),\n", "                 ('tree', DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=123))])\n", "```\n", "\n", "This pipeline will ensure that first we'll apply a Min-Max scaler on our data before fitting a decision tree. However, the `Pipeline()` function above is only defining the sequence of actions to perform. In order to actually fit the model, you need to call the `.fit()` method like so: \n", "\n", "```python\n", "# Fit to the training data\n", "pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)\n", "```\n", "\n", "Then, to score the model on test data, you can call the `.score()` method like so: \n", "\n", "```python\n", "# Calculate the score on test data\n", "pipe.score(X_test, y_test)\n", "```\n", "\n", "A really good blog post on the basic ideas of pipelines can be found [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/12/managing-machine-learning-workflows-scikit-learn-pipelines-part-1.html).\n", "\n", "\n", "## Integrating Grid Search in Pipelines\n", "\n", "Note that the above pipeline simply creates one pipeline for a training set, and evaluates on a test set. Is it possible to create a pipeline that performs grid search? And cross-validation? Yes, it is!\n", "\n", "First, you define the pipeline in the same way as above. Next, you create a parameter grid. When this is all done, you use the function `GridSearchCV()`, which you've seen before, and specify the pipeline as the estimator and the parameter grid. You also have to define how many folds you'll use in your cross-validation. \n", "\n", "```python\n", "# Create the pipeline\n", "pipe = Pipeline([('mms', MinMaxScaler()),\n", "                 ('tree', DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=123))])\n", "\n", "# Create the grid parameter\n", "grid = [{'tree__max_depth': [None, 2, 6, 10], \n", "         'tree__min_samples_split': [5, 10]}]\n", "\n", "\n", "# Create the grid, with \"pipe\" as the estimator\n", "gridsearch = GridSearchCV(estimator=pipe, \n", "                          param_grid=grid, \n", "                          scoring='accuracy', \n", "                          cv=5)\n", "\n", "# Fit using grid search\n", "gridsearch.fit(X_train, y_train)\n", "\n", "# Calculate the test score\n", "gridsearch.score(X_test, y_test)\n", "```\n", "\n", "An article with a detailed workflow can be found [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/01/managing-machine-learning-workflows-scikit-learn-pipelines-part-2.html).\n", "\n", "## Summary\n", "\n", "Great, this wasn't too difficult!
